**dogecoin done right**

the simplest and most secure dogecoin wallet on any platform

![screenshot1](/images/screenshot1.jpg)

**the first standalone iOS dogecoin wallet:**

Unlike other iOS dogecoin wallets, doughwallet is a real standalone dogecoin
client. There is no server to get hacked or go down, so you can always access
your money. Using
[SPV](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security#Header-Only_Clients)
mode, doughwallet connects directly to the dogecoin network with the fast
performance you need on a mobile device.

**the next step in wallet security:**

doughwallet is designed to protect you from malware, browser security holes,
*even physical theft*. With AES hardware encryption, app sandboxing, keychain
and code signatures, doughwallet represents a significant security advance over
web and desktop wallets, and other mobile platforms.

**beautiful simplicity:**

Simplicity is doughwallet's core design principle. A simple backup phrase is
all you need to restore your wallet on another device if yours is ever lost or
broken.  Because doughwallet is  
[deterministic](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki),
your balance and transaction history can be recovered from just your backup
phrase.

**WARNING:** installation on jailbroken devices is strongly discouraged

Any jailbreak app can grant itself access to every other app's keychain data
and rob you by self-signing as described [here](http://www.saurik.com/id/8)
and including `<key>application-identifier</key><string>*</string>` in its
.entitlements file.
